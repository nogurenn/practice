# practice

Some of these programs are written for practice.

Some are born from technical exams and interviews. You may treat the programs here as my potential submission(s) to your exam.

## Structure

Projects are segregated by primary language. In each project (e.g. `golang/project1`), Makefile commands are also present.

Inside `golang/`, for example, you can find "top-level" Makefile commands.

You should be able to run everything with just `make`, Docker + Compose, and simple `env` config for some. Use the project-level Makefiles as reference.
